Your main task is DESIGN TEST CASE for current specified AC.

=========
The following is the AC:
{{{ input }}}

=========
The following in your task in detail:
  1) Think step by step about the AC and its coresponding US, including exist TC for that AC.
      Give improve suggestion for the exist TCs if necessary.
  2) Design new TCs for the AC, focus on typical,boundary,concurrency conditions. 
      All TCs should be independent and cover all possible scenarios.
  3) Generate each UT design detail use following TEMPLATE in code comments style:
/**
 * @[Name]: verify${WhatBehivor}_by${DoWhatAction}
 * @[Purpose]: ${according to what in SPEC, and why to verify in this way}
 * @[Steps]: ${how to do}
 *   1) do ..., with ..., as SETUP
 *   2) do ..., with ..., as BEHAVIOR
 *   3) do ..., with ..., as VERIFY
 *   4) do ..., with ..., as CLEANUP
 * @[Expect]: ${how to verify}
 * @[Notes]:
