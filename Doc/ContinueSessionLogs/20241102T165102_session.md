> **Step 1: Understanding User Stories**
> 
> After reading the provided user stories (US), I have the following understanding:
> 
> * US-1: AS an EvtProducer, when calling IOC_postEVT_inConlesMode, I WANT TO wait for a moment IF AutoLink's internal EvtDescQueue is FULL in ASyncMode OR is NOT EMPTY in SyncMode, SO THAT I can make sure the posting EvtDesc will be processed by IOC.
> 
> I can list or describe at least one use case (UC) for this US:
> 
> * UC-1: EvtProducer calls IOC_postEVT_inConlesMode and waits for a moment if AutoLink's internal EvtDescQueue is full in ASyncMode.
> 	+ Role: EvtProducer
> 	+ Object: IOC_postEVT_inConlesMode function call
> 	+ Operation: Wait for a moment
> 	+ Result: Posting EvtDesc will be processed by IOC
> 
> **Step 2: Identifying Missing or Incomplete User Stories**
> 
> After analyzing the provided user stories, I did not find any missing or incomplete US.
> 
> However, I noticed that there is no mention of performance requirements or quality requirements in the US-1. This might be an area for further discussion and consideration.
> 
> **Step 3: Designing Acceptance Criteria (AC)**
> 
> For each US, I will design acceptance criteria (AC) based on the provided information and considering typical usage, parameter boundary checks, state transitions, performance bottlenecks, concurrent competition, robustness under stress, and fault misuse.
> 
> Here are my designed AC for US-1:
> 
> * AC-1@US-1: GIVEN EvtProducer calling IOC_postEVT_inConlesMode,
> 	+ WHEN IOC's EvtDescQueue is full in ASyncMode by a blocking EvtConsumer cbProcEvt,
> 	+ THEN EvtProducer WILL wait for a moment, until the EvtDescQueue has space,
> 	+ AND the posting EvtDesc will be processed by IOC.
> * AC-2@US-1: GIVEN EvtProducer calling IOC_postEVT_inConlesMode,
> 	+ WHEN IOC's EvtDescQueue is not empty in SyncMode,
> 	+ THEN EvtProducer WILL wait for a moment, until the EvtDescQueue is empty,
> 	+ AND the posting EvtDesc will be processed by IOC.
> 
> I also considered performance requirements and quality requirements:
> 
> * AC-3@US-1: GIVEN EvtProducer calling IOC_postEVT_inConlesMode in high-load scenarios,
> 	+ WHEN IOC's EvtDescQueue is full or not empty,
> 	+ THEN the system WILL NOT crash, and the posting EvtDesc will be processed by IOC within a reasonable time frame.
> * AC-4@US-1: GIVEN EvtProducer calling IOC_postEVT_inConlesMode with incorrect parameters,
> 	+ WHEN IOC's EvtDescQueue is full or not empty,
> 	+ THEN the system WILL NOT crash, and an error message will be logged.
> 
> **Step 4: Reviewing and Refining Acceptance Criteria**
> 
> I reviewed the designed AC for US-1 and refined them based on further consideration:
> 
> * AC-1@US-1 remains the same.
> * AC-2@US-1 is modified to include a specific time frame for waiting:
> 	+ WHEN IOC's EvtDescQueue is not empty in SyncMode,
> 	+ THEN EvtProducer WILL wait for at most 10 seconds, until the EvtDescQueue is empty,
> 	+ AND the posting EvtDesc will be processed by IOC.
> * AC-3@US-1 and AC-4@US-1 remain the same.
> 
> The final refined AC are:
> 
> AC-1@US-1: GIVEN EvtProducer calling IOC_postEVT_inConlesMode,
> WHEN IOC's EvtDescQueue is full in ASyncMode by a blocking EvtConsumer cbProcEvt,
> THEN EvtProducer WILL wait for a moment, until the EvtDescQueue has space,
> AND the posting EvtDesc will be processed by IOC.
